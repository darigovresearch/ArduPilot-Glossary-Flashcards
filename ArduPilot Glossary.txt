2.4 Ghz (ArduPilot Glossary)|"The frequency used by digital (spread spectrum) radio
communications in our applications, including 2.4Ghz RC, Bluetooth and
some video transmission equipment. This is a different band than the
older 72 Mhz band that is used for analog RC communications. To avoid
radio frequency conflict is it often a good idea to use 72 Mhz radio
equipment when you are using 2.4 Ghz onboard video transmitters, or use
900 Mhz video when using 2.4 Ghz RC equipment."

learn. One hopes that an open source alternative will someday emerge."

non-volatile memory of microprocessor based products. It is called
‘firmware’ because it stays in the non-volatile memory even if power is

(compass)."
HIL (Hardware-in-the-loop simulation) (ArduPilot Glossary)|"Doing a simulation where
software running on another computer generates data that simulates the
data that would be coming from an autopilot’s sensors. The autopilot is
running and doesn’t “know” that the data is simulated, so it responds
just as it would to real sensor data. Hardware-in-the-loop uses the
physical autopilot hardware connected to a simulator, as opposed to
simulating the autopilot in software, too. In an “open loop” simulation,
the software simulator feeds data to the hardware autopilot; in a
“closed loop” simulation, the hardware feeds data back to the software
simulator, too."

OilPan. Usually has at least three accelerometers (measuring the gravity
vector in the x,y and z dimensions) and two gyros (measuring rotation
around the tilt and pitch axis). Neither are sufficient by themselves,
since accelerometers are thrown off by movement (ie, they are “noisy”
over short periods of time), while gyros drift over time. The data from
both types of sensors must be combined in software to determine true
aircraft attitude and movement to create an AHRS (see above). One
technique for doing this is the Kalman filter (see below). Now
superseded by Autopilots which include CPU and sensors in one
unit."
Inner loop/Outer loop (ArduPilot Glossary)|"Usually used to refer to the stabilization

and can tolerate delays and interruptions (“outer loop”)."

Thermopile (ArduPilot Glossary)|"An infrared detector. Often used in pairs in UAVs to
measure tilt and pitch by looking at differences in the infrared
signature of the horizon fore and aft and on both sides. This is based
on the fact that there is always an infrared gradient between earth and
sky, and that you can keep a plane flying level by ensuring that the
readings are the same from both sensors in each pair, each looking in
opposite directions. These have been largely displaced by electronic
gyros and are no longer in common use."
