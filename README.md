# ArduPilot-Glossary-Flashcards
Repository containing Anki Flashcards &amp; source code to revise ArduPilot terms

## Introduction
This repository has taken definitions outlined in [ArduPilot's Glossary](https://ardupilot.org/ardupilot/docs/common-glossary.html) and put them into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. The front of every card has "(ArduPilot Glossary)" appended to the end so that if you have any other words in your collection, the ArduPilot definition will still be added when importing it.
2. Any updates or corrections to the deck will be available at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/ArduPilot-Glossary-Flashcards">https://github.com/darigovresearch/ArduPilot-Glossary-Flashcards</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.

Feel free to share the deck and give the repository a star so more people are likely to see this work and can get the most out of it.

## Usage
If you want to just learn the words, download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> on your device of choice and open the .apkg file to add it into your collection. If you wish to build the deck from scratch you will need to import the .txt file via the desktop with HTML enabled and the separator to be "|".

## Potential Improvements Yet to be Made
1. To find a way to systematically pull the definitions from so that any corrections or additions are automatically updated.
2. To be able to automatically sort the cards so that the words which are used most in the glossary (or the documentation as a whole) is displayed first for the user to learn.
